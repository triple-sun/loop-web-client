# Project goals

The main goal of this project is to create a web-client for Loop (a fork of Mattermost) which should be:

* Modern
* Easy to use
* Compatible both with nodejs and browser
* Strongly typed
* Performance-efficient

You should consider these as main goals when you are doing a code review or writing tests
